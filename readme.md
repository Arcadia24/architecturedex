#Architecture Dex#

The goal of this project is to expose the most of small project usefull to prog in DL

##MNIST for Web##

The project is to deploy MNIST on web using Gradio and Pytorch Lightning

run the project:

```python3 main.py```

##RNN##

The project aim to create a Recurrent Neural Network to learn about it.

##RNN LSTM##

RNN LSTM project is a project make the diffrence between RNN and LSTM on their performance.

##Vit Lightning##

Transformers are really important nowaday and understand how they work is important. 
I create a Vision Transformer from scratch to learn about attention mechanism.
